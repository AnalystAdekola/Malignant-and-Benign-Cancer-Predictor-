Logistic and Decision Tree Model Training on Cancer Dataset
ABOUT DATASET:

ðŸ¦  Breast Cancer Data Set

This dataset contains the characteristics of patients diagnosed with cancer. The dataset contains a unique ID for each patient, the type of cancer (diagnosis), the visual characteristics of the cancer and the average values of these characteristics.

ðŸ“š The main features of the dataset are as follows:
ID: Represents a unique ID of each patient.
Diagnosis: Indicates the type of cancer. This property can take the values "M" (Malignant - Benign) or "B" (Benign - Malignant).
radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean: Represents the mean values of the cancer's visual characteristics.
There are also several categorical features where patients in the dataset are labeled with numerical values.

Other features contain specific ranges of average values of the features of the cancer image: radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean Each of these features is mapped to a table containing the number of values in a given range.


Understanding the Data:

diagnosis: This is the target variable for my logistic regression model, indicating whether the cancer is benign or malignant. Dropping Unnecessary Features:

id: This column is a unique identifier for each patient and doesn't provide any predictive information. Therefore, it can be dropped. Keeping Relevant Features:

All other features: The remaining features, including those related to the mean, standard error, and worst values of various visual characteristics, are likely to be relevant for predicting the diagnosis. Potential Feature Engineering:

While the existing features are likely to be informative, I might consider some feature engineering to improve the model's performance:

Creating Ratios: Calculate ratios between features (e.g., radius_mean and area_mean) to capture relationships that might not be immediately apparent.

Transforming Features: If the distributions of features are skewed, I'll consider transformations like log or square root to normalize them.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): If I have a large number of correlated features, PCA can help reduce dimensionality while preserving most of the variance. Model Building and Evaluation:

Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Train the Model: Use logistic regression to train a model on the training set.

Evaluate the Model: Use metrics like accuracy to evaluate the model's performance on the testing set.

Iterate and Improve: If the initial performance is not satisfactory, I'll consider adjusting hyperparameters, trying different feature engineering techniques, or exploring other algorithms.
